# SpringBoot_Assignment_ Url_Hit_Count

## Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Project
Create a new Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializr and import required dependency.

## Step 2: Create a UrlHitController Class
Under the controller package, create a new class called "UrlHitController". In this class, define a GET mapping method that will handle requests to the "/count" endpoint. This method should call the service layer to increment the hit count.

## Step 3: Create a UrlHitService Class
Under the service package, create a new class called "UrlHitService". In this class, define a method to increment the hit count. 


## Step 4: Test Your Application
Start your application and make a GET request to the "/count" endpoint. Verify that the response contains the expected hit count.
